Dessiree Green,"Dilemma- there's a pest or some type of critter stuck in between the wall in our closest. We can hear the little guy burrowing and scratching and squeaking and so do our cats.. which is driving them crazy. Do we let it die which would stink up our bedroom. or... what? How do you get a critter out of the wall? If he does get out on his own, he picked the wrong house, as our 4 cats wouldn't give the guy a chance."
